# Exercise 2: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored the first 4 games of last season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores 2016")
seahawks <- c(36, 10, 12, 3)
# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games
others <- c(6, 9, 10, 9)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
scores <- data.frame(seahawks, others)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
scores[["diff"]] <- abs(seahawks - others)

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom
scores[["won"]] <- seahawks > others

# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c("Cardinals", "Vikings", "Dolphins", "Rams")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
rownames(scores) <- opponents
